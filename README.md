# Puzzle-Solver

This is a project designed to allow me to practice creating algorithms to solve puzzles using some sort of search algorithm.
The puzzles I plan on solving will be from the app Logic Games on the App Store and Google Play store, for more info see here: http://www.andreasabbatini.com/LogicGames.aspx
I will not be including any actual puzzle files on this repository.
